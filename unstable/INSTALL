Microracers - INSTALL
---------------------
http://microracers.sourceforge.net/

To compile the game, just type 'make' in the root package directory.
Don't type make in src/, but in root directory, else it will not be
possible to install.

To install, type 'make install'. You don't need to install the game
in the system though. You can just play it from its package dir.
The game is intalled by default under /usr/. To install it under another
directory, just edit the PREFIX on the root Makefile.

To uninstall, type 'make uninstall'.

Microracers does a trick that makes it possible to execute by just clicking
on it using a graphical file manager. No need to open a console.
(It won't work on symbolic links.)
